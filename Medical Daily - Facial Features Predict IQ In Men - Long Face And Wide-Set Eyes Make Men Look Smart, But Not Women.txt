Men, but not women, with a long face and wide-set eyes are perceived as more intelligent.

In both sexes, a narowwer face with a thinner chin, and a larger, prolonged nose characterized the predicted stereotype of a higher IQ, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose led to a prediction of low-intelligence.
