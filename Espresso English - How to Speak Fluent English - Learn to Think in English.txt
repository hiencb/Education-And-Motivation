Level 1: Thinking in individual English words
  In the morning: bed, toothbrush, bathroom, banana, coffee, clothes, shoes
  Go to work: car, job, company, desk, computer, paper, pencil, colleague, boss
  During the day, continue to think of the individual English words for everything you see, hear, and do

Level 2: Thinking in complete sentences
- When at lunch:
    + I'm eating a sandwich.
    + My friend is drinking a soda.
    + This restaurant is very good
- When watching TV:
    + That actress is beautiful.
    + The journalist has black hair.
    + He's talking about politics
  
Level 3: Functional English
- Imagine using English for everthing you need to do. After everytime your speak, think of how you would say that in English
    + A round-trip ticket to Central Station, please.
    + Could I have a lemonade with no sugar?

Level 4: Narrative English
- Telling a story or speaking for a long time in English.
- It's best to do this exercise when you have some time - like while waiting in line or taking public transportation.
- Think of a memory or a story that you would like to tell an English-speaking friend. Then "tell the story" in your head in English.
