1. Try a quick fix: 
  - Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task
  - Listen to music with deep bass
  - Strike a powerful pose
  - Give yourself a pep talk
2. Believe in your ability to improve
  - Have a growth mindset (opposed to a fixed mindset): a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow
  - People who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better in the face of challenges
3. Practice failure
  - J.K Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter"
  - The Wright Brothers build on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane
  - Those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges and setbacks in a constructive. The learn how to try different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere.

Give yourself a pep talk, stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greated knowledge and understanding. This is confidence.
